# HackerRank | Java

Hey! These are my solutions on Java HackerRank. They are organized on files with a Solution class and an input.txt, so the answers are slightly different than the ones you are supposed to do on the site.

To check out my explanations about the exercises (in PT/BR :brazil:) you can visit [dev.to/beatrizmaciel](https://dev.to/beatrizmaciel).

I hope this will be helpful :) If you have any questions you can message me on dev.to!
